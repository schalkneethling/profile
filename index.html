        <p class="about-me-bio">I fell in love with the web 15 years ago and ever since then I have been an evangelist
          for open source, the open web, and web accessibility. As an indie maker, open source developer, mentor, and
          podcaster, I love bringing new ideas to life and elevating voices aiming to make a positive impact. I believe
          in respect, openness, and creating opportunities for growth.</p>
